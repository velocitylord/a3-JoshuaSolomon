## Gino Hills Barbershop

My render server: https://a3-joshuasolomon-2.onrender.com

The application is Gino Hills Barbershop - it is an improved version of my A2 project where the user can select a variety of haircut options and add them to their cart. I had a huge challenge implementing Oauth, which took me lots of trial and error. I utilized the Passport.js library and I was able to follow along youtube videos to get a grasp of implementing it in my page (https://youtu.be/zkOXQSR3ClM?si=sF-mVFFzrhIYQnc4).
I used CSS Tailwind, I didn't make any modifications to the framework, I did use this website: https://gradienty.codes/animated-icons to give me ideas of entry animations for my page.

I implemented a barbershop app using Tailwind. I implemented animations from the website Gradienty, layered images in the back/gradient/tint backgrounds, utilized svg icons (from Heroicons), and used various fonts which I accessed from google fonts. On the backend, i utilized express, MongoDB user creation, customized auth middleware, and route handlers to navigate between the login and home page. I used Tailwind CLI to build styles.css, and the server serves images for both pages.
