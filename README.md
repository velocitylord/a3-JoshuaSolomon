## Your Web Application Title

Your Render (or alternative server) link e.g. https://a3-joshuasolomon-2.onrender.com

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
The application is Gino Hills Barbershop - it is an improved version of my A2 project where the user can select a variety of haircut options and add to their cart
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
I faced a big challenge implementing the authentication.
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
I honestly was not able to implement a working authentication strategy
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
I used CSS Tailwind, I didn't make any modifications to the framework, I did use this website: https://gradienty.codes/animated-icons to give me an idea of animations for my page.
- a list of Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function, please add a little more detail about what it does.
express.static 
express.json
requireAuth
express-session 
attachUser

I implemented a barbershop app using Tailwind. I implemented Gradienty animations, layered images in the back/gradient/tint backgrounds, and various fonts which I accessed from google fonts. On the backend, i utilized express, MongoDB user creation, and custom middleware (attachUser/require) and managed routing to the login and home pages. Tailwind CLI builds styles.css, and the  server serves images for both pages.
